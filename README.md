# pagepiling.js demostration with React app

This is a demonstration of how to use [pagepiling.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/pagePiling/) within the React App to achieve full page scroll in your site.

Original by [@am-chourasia](https://github.com/am-chourasia). All I've done was update it a bit from class component (and ComponentDidMount) to functional component (and useEffect).

### For preview, run the following script:

- `npm install` : Install the npm dependencies
- `npm start` : To start the server and preview the app

You can modify the pagepiling property using various options provided in the official github page of [pagepiling.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/pagePiling.js).
